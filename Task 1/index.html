       Often referred to as the "sea eagle," the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) is a large predatory bird that is found throughout temperate Eurasia.  Like all eagles, it belongs to the Accipitridae (or accipitrids) family, which also includes harriers, kites, and hawks, among other diurnal raptors.  The white-tailed sea-eagle is another name for one of the eleven species in the genus Haliaeetus, commonly known as sea eagles. Depending on the source, it is sometimes referred to as the Eurasian sea eagle, gray sea eagle, or erne.
